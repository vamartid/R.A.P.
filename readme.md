Although RAP is a music category the name,
stands forfor Resource Allocation Problem.

This project is an implementation of the Resource Allocation Problem.
There are some objects called resources,
 and There are some other runnable-objects called Costumers.
Costumers can allocate a number of resource object to run.
If a costumer is not able to allocate the number of the resources he 
needs he waits till he is able to.
If he finds them he is able to run.
